# Everything is Hostile 2
Everything is hostile was originally developed by the Breakin Block's community on Reddit. /r/breakinblocks. 
This is a 1.10.2 continuation of the original with many changes to accomodate new mods. New progression paths, new quests and new challenges.
The pack was designed with a challenging environment in mind. To achieve that we've got several mods that increase mob difficulty such as 
Infernal mobs, special AI, Epic Seige Mod, Ender Zoo, Mo' creatures and several others. Bloodmoons occur automatically every 28 minecraft days.

For magic we have just about every stable magic mod avaialble and integrated with custom balance tweaks to make all paths equally rewarding.
Our progression system is driven via exploration and the Quest guide will assist you through all that the pack has to offer. 

Being as the pack is heavily exploration focused you'll also find Abyssalcraft and it's several intriguing dimensions, VoidCraft, Exu's Dimensions
custom dungeons, as well as Quark Worldgen. Each world, inculding the overworld has enhanced worldgen thanks to Roguelike Dungeons, Biome Bundle, and several other mods adding unqiue flavor and challenge.

The pack is continuously updated by the community in response to feedback. We also watch our github closely for any issue to respond quickly with fixes.
